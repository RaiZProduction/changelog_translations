Open-source translations for Changelog Habit Tracker

Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asmodeoux.changelog

App Store: https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/changelog-habit-tracker/id1537820647

Translation consists of 2 files:
1) Main json file with strings used in the app
2) Special file with translation of iOS permission-request messages

These first strings in every line is a line's ID, so you don't need to translate it. for example:
"one" : "week" —> "one" : "неделя"

If your language needs to change words order or some words themselves to keep the meaning understandable for locals — no problem, do that. I should also mention that RTL languages like Arabic were not tested yet, so I'm not sure if I will be able to add these soon.

Don't interrupt {} and \n symbols as well — the brackets stand for numbers and \n for starting a new line. And please translate both and pull your files named properly, let me know your name and social network link if you wish to be added to About us section 🙃
